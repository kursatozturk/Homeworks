<h1> HW2 <br> 
(Some exercises are adapted from <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment1/">CS231n</a> course materials of Standford University)</h1>
</center>

<h2>Deadline</h2>
17 December, 2018 (midnight).

<h2>Description </h2>
<p>In this HW, you will implement some of the tools we have covered in the lectures. The goals of this assignment are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>understand and implement the operations/layers in a Convolutional Neural Network.</li>
<li>apply CNN to a classification problem.</li>
<li>implement some of the mechanisms that are widely used for understanding/interpreting a trained CNN. More specifically, you will use a pre-trained CNN to show some saliency maps for a given class, generate best images for a given class (a.k.a., deep dream), and learn how to fool a CNN.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Get the code as a zip file <a href="http://kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~sinan/DL/HW2.zip">here</a>. As for the dependencies (similar to HW1):</p>

<p><strong>Use Anaconda:</strong>
The preferred approach for installing all the HW dependencies is to use <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>,
 which is a Python distribution that includes many of the most popular 
Python packages for science, math, engineering and data analysis. Once 
you install it and you're 
ready to go directly to working on the HW.</p>

<p><strong>Download data:</strong>
Once you have the starter code, you will need to download the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.
Run the following from the <code>HW2</code> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd </span>cs231n/datasets
./get_datasets.sh
</code></pre></div>
For the CNN exercises, you will need to download another dataset and a pre-trained model. The instructions for these are outlined in the respective exercises.

<p><strong>Start IPython:</strong>
After you have the MNIST data, you should start the IPython notebook server from the
<code>HW2</code> directory. If you are unfamiliar with IPython, you should read the
<a href="http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial">IPython tutorial</a>.</p>


<h3>Submitting your work:</h3>

<p>Once you are done working run the <code>collectSubmission.sh</code> script; this will produce a file called
<code>HW2.zip</code>. Upload this file on the METUclass page of the course.</p>

<h3> Task 1: Modular layers in CNN (20 points) </h3>

<p> The IPython Notebook <strong>task1_layers.ipynb</strong> will walk you through implementing the layers in a CNN in a modular manner.</p>

<h3> Task 2: Combine modular layers to train a CNN (20 points) </h3>

<p> The IPython Notebook <strong>task2_convnet.ipynb</strong> will walk you through combining the modular layers to implement a CNN architecture.</p>

<h3>Task 3: Image Gradients (5 points) </h3>

<p>The IPython Notebook <strong>task3_image_gradients.ipynb</strong> will walk you through how you can use a trained CNN to compute saliency maps, and how you can fool a trained CNN.</p>

<h3>Task 4: Image Generation (15 points) </h3>

<p>The IPython Notebook <strong>task4_image_generation.ipynb</strong> will walk you through implementing some of the mechanisms used for understanding/interpreting a trained CNN.</p>

<h3>Task 5: Blood Pressure from a PPG signal using CNNs (40 points) </h3>

<p>Solve Task 4 in HW1 using CNNs this time. The problem definition is exactly the same. The only difference is that you will use a CNN this time. Build your solution in the IPython Notebook <strong>task5_blood_pressure.ipynb</strong>.
